TODO: build the image and run the container for client app
## 62-001 Installing Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is a tool for running a bunch of different containers together. It will automatically manage the creation and management of all 
these different containers and it's also gonna make it easy for us to communicate between these containers as well.

We give kubernetes some configuration to describe how we want our containers to run and interact with each other.

There are tww possibilities for setting up kubernetes:
Either you're running docker for windows/mac, OR you're running docker-toolbox or linux.
Now for option 1, go to docker system tray icon, go to preferences>kubernetes>enable kubernetes .

For option 2, we need to install mini kube. Mini kube is a tool that will start up a kubernetes cluster on your local machine.

Docker toolbox is not stable.

## 63-002 IMPORTANT Note for Minikube and MicroK8s Users:
To make sure kubernetes is running successfully, open a new terminal window(if you already have one open) and run:
```shell
kubectl version
```
